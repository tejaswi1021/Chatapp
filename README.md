# Multithreaded chat app in java
This is a simple console-based multithreaded chat application built using Java sockets and threads.
The app supports multiple clients connected to a central server, allowing real-time group messaging between them

# Technologies Used:

Java

Sockets (java.net)

Multithreading (java.lang.Thread)

Command-line interface (CLI)

 # How It Works:

The server listens on a port (1234) and accepts multiple clients.

Each client connects to the server, provides a username, and sends/receives messages.

Each client runs on a separate thread on the server to support concurrent communication.
